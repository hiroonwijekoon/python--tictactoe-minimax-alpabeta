# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Project

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe AI Project repository! This project provides implementations of Tic-Tac-Toe with various AI player strategies in Python. These strategies range from simple random moves to sophisticated algorithms such as Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## Player Strategies

### 1. **PlayerRandom**

- **Description:** Implements a player that makes random moves.

### 2. **Player_L0**

- **Description:** Implements a player that selects moves based on predefined patterns.

### 3. **Player_L1**

- **Description:** Builds upon `Player_L0` with offensive strategies.

### 4. **Player_L2**

- **Description:** Further enhances `Player_L1` with defensive strategies.

### 5. **Player_MiniMax**

- **Description:** Implements the Minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making.

### 6. **Player_MiniMaxAlphaBeta**

- **Description:** Enhances the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for improved performance.

## Testing and Analysis

The `game_control` function orchestrates simulations between different player strategies, providing win ratios for analysis.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Fork the repository or download the source code.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:** Explore the provided Jupyter notebook for demonstrations and further understanding.
3. **Integrate into Your Project:** Copy the required player functions into your codebase for use in your projects.

Feel free to experiment with different player strategies and analyze their performance in different scenarios! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to contribute or reach out. Happy coding! ðŸŽ®ðŸ¤–
